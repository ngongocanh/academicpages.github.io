My name is Ngoc Anh Ngo. I have a PhD in Economics from VSB - Technical University of Ostrava. Currently, I work for the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic. My passion is data analysis, as it enables me to tell evidence-based stories and contribute to policy-making. I have worked mainly in academia and the public sector. Besides data analysis, my strengths lie in project management/administration, coordination of complex tasks, event management and public speaking.

My academic research centers around applied macroeconomics and financial stability with focus on non-bank financial intermediaries. However, I am well-versed in other topics, such as financial analysis of firms. I use various programming languages and analytical tools (Python, R, Stata, VBA).
